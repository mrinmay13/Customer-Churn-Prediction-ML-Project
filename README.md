Customer Churn Prediction ML Project

üìå Overview
Customer churn refers to when customers stop doing business with a company. This project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on various features such as demographic information, account details, and service usage.

By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can take proactive steps to retain them, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce revenue loss.

üéØ Problem Statement
Develop a classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn using data such as:

- Demographic info (e.g., gender, senior citizen status)
- Account details (e.g., tenure, contract type)
- Services used (e.g., internet service, online security, phone service)

The goal is to support business decisions and customer retention strategies using data-driven insights.
